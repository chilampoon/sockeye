Sockeye
"""""""""

Sockeye is a research Snakemake pipeline designed to identify the cell barcode
and UMI sequences present in nanopore sequencing reads generated from single-cell gene expression libraries. It currently supports the following single-cell kits from 10X Genomics:

- Chromium Single Cell `3สน gene expression <https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/10xChromium3.html>`_, versions 2 and 3
- Chromium Single Cell `5สน gene expression <https://teichlab.github.io/scg_lib_structs/methods_html/10xChromium5.html>`_, version 1

Oxford Nanopore has developed a protocol for sequencing single-cell libraries from 10X, which can be found on the Nanopore Community `website <https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols/single-cell-transcriptomics-10x/v/sst_v9148_v111_revb_12jan2022>`_.

The inputs to Sockeye are raw nanopore reads (FASTQ) generated from the sequencing
instrument and reference files that can be downloaded from `10X
<https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/downloads/latest>`_.
The pipeline outputs a gene x cell expression matrix, as well as a BAM file of
aligned reads tagged with cell barcode and UMI information.

Prerequisites
-------------

``conda`` must be installed in order to create the base environment where the
Sockeye snakemake pipeline will run. Installation instructions can be found in
the conda `documentation <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_.

Package dependencies
--------------------

The Sockeye pipeline makes use of the following dependencies. No manual
installation is required, as these are all installed automatically into a series
of ``conda`` environments that are created throughout the course of a pipeline
run:

- bedtools [1_]
- bioframe [2_]
- biopython [3_]
- editdistance [4_]
- matplotlib [5_]
- minimap2 [6_]
- numpy [7_]
- pandas [8_]
- parasail-python [9_]
- pysam [10_]
- samtools [11_]
- scikit-learn [12_]
- seqkit [13_]
- tqdm [14_]
- umap-learn [15_]
- vsearch [16_]

Additionally, while no explicit dependency exists for the
`UMI-tools <https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools>`_ package  [17_], the Sockeye script
``cluster_umis.py`` makes significant use of several functions from
the package. More detailed acknowledgements can be found in the source code.

Installation
------------

The project source code must first be cloned from the Oxford Nanopore repository
on GitHub:

::

   git clone git@github.com:nanoporetech/sockeye.git
   cd sockeye

Next you must create and activate the ``conda`` environment (named ``sockeye``)
that contains the necessary packages for calling the Snakemake pipeline:

::

   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate sockeye

Getting Started
---------------

Prior to demultiplexing any nanopore reads, pipeline configurations and sample sheet information must be specified:

Downloading reference data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pipeline requires access to reference data files that are packaged and freely available from `10X Genomics <https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/downloads/latest>`_. For human samples, the GRCh38 packaged reference files can be downloaded using either ``curl`` or ``wget`` using:

::

   cd /PATH/TO/10X/DOWNLOADS
   curl -O https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz
   tar -xvf refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz

or

::

   cd /PATH/TO/10X/DOWNLOADS
   wget https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz
   tar -xvf refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz

Once downloaded, specify the full path to the packaged reference directory (e.g. ``refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A``) in the ``config/config.yml`` file using the ``REF_GENOME_DIR`` variable.

Specifying 10X cell barcode list directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the reference data, Sockeye will also download the lists of all possible 10x cell barcodes (a.k.a. the barcode "longlists") used in the 3' and 5' gene expression kits. These files will be automatically downloaded at runtime to the directory specified by the ``BC_LONGLIST_DIR`` variable in the ``config/config.yml`` file.  It is a good idea to use the same directory where the 10X reference data is located, so that all supporting data from 10X is consolidated in one location.

Setting up the pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pipeline configurations are described in the YAML file ``config/config.yml``:

::

   SAMPLE_SHEET: "./config/samples.csv"

   OUTPUT_BASE: /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/BASE/DIRECTORY

   ################################################################################
   # 10x SUPPORTING FILES                                                         #
   ################################################################################
   # Reference files can be downloaded from the 10x website using either curl or wget:
   # For the human GRCh38 reference, the commands would be:
   # curl -O https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz
   # or
   # wget https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz

   ######### REF_GENOME_DIR #########
   # REF_GENOME_DIR refers the path to reference directory as downloaded from 10x,
   # e.g. /PATH/TO/10X/DOWNLOADS/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A
   REF_GENOME_DIR: /PATH/TO/10X/DOWNLOADS/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A

   ######### BC_LONGLISTS #########
   # Specify the path where the 10X cell barcode longlists will be downloaded. It's
   # good idea to use the location where you have downloaded the 10X reference
   # data, e.g. /PATH/TO/10X/DOWNLOADS/
   BC_LONGLIST_DIR: /PATH/TO/10X/DOWNLOADS/

   MAX_THREADS: 4

   READ_STRUCTURE_BATCH_SIZE: 40000
   READ_STRUCTURE_FLAGS: ""

   BARCODE_ADAPTER1_SUFF_LENGTH: 10
   BARCODE_KNEEPLOT_FLAGS: ""
   BARCODE_MAX_ED: 2
   BARCODE_MIN_ED_DIFF: 2

   GENE_ASSIGNS_MINQV: 60

   UMI_GENOMIC_INTERVAL: 1000
   UMI_CELL_GENE_MAX_READS: 20000
   UMI_CLUSTER_MAX_THREADS: 4

   MATRIX_MIN_GENES: 100
   MATRIX_MIN_CELLS: 3
   MATRIX_MAX_MITO: 5
   MATRIX_NORM_COUNT: 10000

   # Using a comma-separated list, specify which genes should be annotated in the
   # UMAP plots (e.g. CD19,PAX5,XBP1)
   UMAP_PLOT_GENES: CD19,CD24,CD27,CD38,CD79A,CD79B,PAX5,XBP1

   # Set the maximum resources to devote to the minimap2 alignment step
   RESOURCES_MM2_MEM_GB: 50
   RESOURCES_MM2_MAX_THREADS: 4

Most of the parameters defined in the ``config/config.yml`` file can normally remain unchanged. However, certain fields require editing, such as:

::

   OUTPUT_BASE     # Base directory where run_id-specific output folders will be written
   REF_GENOME_DIR  # Path to the downloaded 10X reference data
   BC_LONGLIST_DIR # Path to download 10X cell barcode longlists
   MAX_THREADS     # Maximum number of threads to use for various steps in the pipeline
   UMAP_PLOT_GENES # Genes to annotate in UMAP plots

Editing the sample sheet
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The path to the sample sheet is defined by the ``SAMPLE_SHEET`` variable in the ``config.yml`` file described above (set to ``./config/samples.csv`` by default). This sample sheet contains details about the input run IDs, the 10X kits used (e.g. ``3prime`` or ``5prime``), the kit versions used (``v2`` or ``v3`` for the 3' kit, ``v1`` for the 5' kit), and the path to the ONT input reads. Sockeye can launch analyses of multiple runs simultaneously, which is especially useful when submitting the analyses to a compute cluster.

The ONT input reads specified in the sample sheet can be either a directory path (where all FASTQ files in the directory will be combined as the input) or an explicit path to a single FASTQ file. The supported FASTQ extensions are ``*.fastq``, ``*.fq``, ``*.fastq.gz`` or ``*.fq.gz``. If a directory path is supplied, all file extensions within the directory must be the same -- mixtures of different file extensions within an input directory are not supported.

The ``config/samples.csv`` file might look as follows:

::

   run_id,kit_name,kit_version,path
   run1,3prime,v3,/PATH/TO/ONT/INPUT/READS1.fq.gz
   run2,3prime,v3,/PATH/TO/ONT/INPUT/READS2.fq.gz
   run3,5prime,v1,/PATH/TO/ONT/INPUT/RUN3/

where ``run3`` points to an input directory containing one or more FASTQ files from a given sample, rather than pointing to a single FASTQ input file.

Launching Sockeye
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the Sockeye environment has been created and activated (see Installation above) and both the ``config.yml`` and ``samples.csv`` files have been edited, the Sockeye pipeline is ready to be launched.

Launch Sockeye locally from the Sockeye repository using:

::

   snakemake --use-conda --configfile config/config.yml -pr all

If your cluster system supports Distributed Resource Management Application API (DRMAA), you can submit the Sockeye pipeline to your job scheduler using:
::

   snakemake --configfile config/config.yml --latency-wait 300 --drmaa ' -V -cwd -P <cluster_profile> -l m_mem_free={resources.mem}G -pe mt {threads} ' --default-resources mem=1 --jobs 1000 --use-conda --drmaa-log-dir ./drmaa_logs -pr all

More details on cluster execution for various systems can be found `here <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cluster.html>`_.

Pipeline output
---------------

The pipeline output will be written to a directory defined by ``OUTPUT_BASE`` in the ``config/config.yml`` file. For instance, using the example ``config/config.yml`` and ``config/sample_sheet.csv`` files shown above, the pipeline output would be written to three separate directories, one for each ``run_id``:

::

   /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/BASE/DIRECTORY/run1
   /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/BASE/DIRECTORY/run2
   /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/BASE/DIRECTORY/run3

Each run_id-specific output folder will contain the following subdirectories:

::

   /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/BASE/DIRECTORY/run1
   |
   |-- adapters   # contains output from the characterization of read structure based on adapters
   |-- align      # output from the alignment to the reference
   |-- demux      # demultiplexing results, primarily in the tagged.sorted.bam file
   |-- matrix     # gene expression matrix and UMAP outputs
   \-- saturation # plots describing the library sequencing saturation

The most useful outputs of the pipeline are likely:

* ``adapters/configs.stats.json``: provides a summary of sequencing statistics and observed read configurations, such as

  - ``n_reads``: number of total reads in the input fastq(s)
  - ``rl_mean``: mean read length
  - ``n_fl``: total number of reads with the read1-->TSO or TSO'-->read1' adapter configuration (i.e. full-length reads)
  - ``n_plus``: number of reads with the read1-->TSO configuration
  - ``n_minus``: number of reads with the TSO'-->read1' configuration

* ``demux/tagged.sorted.bam``: BAM file of alignments to the reference where each alignment contains the following sequence tags

  - CB: corrected cell barcode sequence
  - CR: uncorrected cell barcode sequence
  - CY: Phred quality scores of the uncorrected cell barcode sequence
  - UB: corrected UMI sequence
  - UR: uncorrected UMI sequence
  - UY: Phred quality scores of the uncorrected UMI sequence

* ``matrix/gene_expression.processed.tsv``: TSV containing the gene (rows) x cell (columns) expression matrix, processed and normalized according to the parameters defined in the ``config/config.yml`` file:

  - ``MATRIX_MIN_GENES``: cells with fewer than this number of expressed genes will be removed
  - ``MATRIX_MIN_CELLS``: genes present in fewer than this number of cells will be removed
  - ``MATRIX_MAX_MITO``: cells with more than this percentage of counts belonging to mitochondrial genes will be removed
  - ``MATRIX_NORM_COUNT``: normalize all cells to this number of total counts per cell
